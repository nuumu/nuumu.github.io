<p>1. About/Bio – A well-crafted bio should be the main focus of your portfolio. This will most likely be your home page. Introduce yourself to your audience in a powerful, memorable way. Writing a great bio should take more time than any other piece of your portfolio! Write a few different versions and test with friends and family. Ask them to read one of your versions and write down the 3 adjectives that come to mind after a read-through. Are those the descriptors you were hoping for? Keep refining your bio until you’re certain that the version you choose will be successful in capturing audience interest and compelling them to take the action you want (i.e. emailing you immediately to redesign their site!).</p>

<p>If you have a headshot, or a friend that can take a headshot, absolutely, positively include it on your site. Even getting professional headshots may be worth the (hopefully small) investment – depending on your city and the photographer, you can setup a session for about $100 (although, rates can go up to $1500 for professional headshot photographers!).</p>
