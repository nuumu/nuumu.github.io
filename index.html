<p class="serif">Hello! My name is Lucy and I currently live in Los Angeles.</p><br />

<p class="serif">Prior to Los Angeles, I had been living in Silicon Valley and working in software companies as a web producer/web content publisher. Because the majority of my work is specifically for use within the company, I do not have work samples to show.</p><br />

<p class="serif">However, I have made this online portfolio to show you what I can do. These are samples that I have designed and coded.</p>
